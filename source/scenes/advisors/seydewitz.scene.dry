@class_struggle
title: Rally for class struggle
subtitle: The core of <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span> should be the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.

Our message of class struggle appeals to the left wing of the working class, while potentially alienating the middle class. [? if nationalization_progress > 0 : Our achievements in nationalization have assisted our messaging. ?]

Seydewitz supports building up the <span style="color: #c00000;">Socialist</span> Youth, which attracts support to the Left and increases the militancy of the Reichsbanner.

We have grown tired of the burdens of toleration, and have called a vote of no confidence in the current minority government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

New Prussian elections have been set for [+ next_election_month_prussia : month +] [+ next_election_year_prussia +].

A double dissolution has shaken the people's faith in democracy, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.

While this is a setback, it is not the worst possible outcome, as new elections could have led to significant gains for extremist parties.
