= Marie Juchacz

Juchacz is the founder of the Worker's Welfare, our mutual aid organization; her experiences as a single mother in poverty led her to <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>. She is the most senior woman among the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> leadership, who is often treated as the "go-to" when the predominantly male leadership sought out womens' voices.

[? if emergency_used <= 1: Juchacz has leveraged her position to pull in donations and arrange quick loans. ?][? if emergency_used > 1 and emergency_used < 3: Discontent is brewing among the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>'s rank and file due to our persistent attempts at begging for money. ?][? if emergency_used > 2: We’re really scraping the barrel now—committed members are pressured into selling their valuables, while many others leave in frustration. ?]

We have gained +2 resources.

We have increased funding to Workers' Welfare. [? if black_thursday_seen > 0 : In an age of economic crisis, this will be helpful for improving our standing among the unemployed. ?]

@organizing_women

subtitle: Juchacz's strategies are aimed at more "traditional" women.

on-arrival: womens_rights += 1; workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent); rural_spd += 3*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 3*(1-dissent); advisor_action_timer = 0

Juchacz's strategies for organizing women are aimed at working-class housewives, and acknowledge women's traditional household roles. We argue that our economic welfare programs will improve the livelihoods of women and their families.

[? if spd_r < 50 : Unfortunately, women still disproportionately support the bourgeois parties. ?]
