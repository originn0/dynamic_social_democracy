Through his work, Rosenfeld has defended individual <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> members; this should make some connections possible.

We have grown tired of the burdens of toleration, and have called a vote of no confidence in the current minority government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

New Prussian elections have been set for [+ next_election_month_prussia : month +] [+ next_election_year_prussia +].

A double dissolution has shaken the people's faith in democracy, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.
