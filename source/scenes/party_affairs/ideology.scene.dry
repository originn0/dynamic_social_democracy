= Questions of Ideology

The <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> is torn between many different ideological currents. What should be our primary ideological guidance for now?

[? if ideology != 0 : We have previously chosen a [+ ideology +] ideology. Changing it will likely have drawbacks. ?]

- @class_struggle: Class struggle and preparing the proletariat for the revolution are our primary goals.
- @centrist: The Center <span style="color: #9B0000;">Marxism</span> of Karl Kautsky remains the best way to resolve our internal contradictions.
- @labor: We should work with the trade unions to improve the lives of workers.
- @reform: Following Eduard Bernstein, we should work for ethical <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>, strengthen democracy, and expand the party's electorate.
- @socpat: Pursue the fusion of <span style='color: #c00000;'>socialism</span> and patriotism.
- @easy_discard

The radical left of the party supports a course of class struggle, and potentially a reconciliation with the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.

@centrist
on-arrival: {!
if (Q.ideology && Q.ideology != "centrist") {
    Q.changed = 1;
}
!}
go-to: changed if changed = 1
on-departure: ideology = "centrist"; center_strength += 8; center_dissent -= 10; left_dissent -= 5; reformist_dissent -= 5

The Center Marxists, represented by Kautsky and Hilferding, support a middle course of preparing for revolution while building up the consciousness of the working class.

@labor
on-arrival: {!
if (Q.ideology && Q.ideology != "labor") {
    Q.changed = 1;
}
!}
go-to: changed if changed = 1
on-departure: ideology = "labor"; labor_strength += 8; center_dissent += 5; wtb_support += 1; labor_dissent -= 5; kpd_relation -= 3

The labor wing of the party supports continued participation in government in order to provide benefits to the workers, and the creation of public works programs for employment.

@reform
on-arrival: {!
if (Q.ideology && Q.ideology != "reformist") {
    Q.changed = 1;
}
!}
go-to: changed if changed = 1
on-departure: ideology = "reformist"; reformist_strength += 8; democratization += 1; reformist_dissent -= 5; left_dissent += 5; z_relation += 5; dvp_relation += 5; ddp_relation += 5; lvp_relation += 5; kpd_relation -= 8; moderate_plan_support += 1; dvp_left += 1; ddp_left += 0.5; ddp_cohesion += 0.5; lvp_left += 1

The reformist wing of the party seeks to preserve the Republic and the democratic system of government, and is most supportive of coalitions with the other pro-democracy parties.

@socpat

on-arrival: {!
if (Q.ideology && Q.ideology != "socpat") {
    Q.changed = 1;

go-to: changed if changed = 1

The social patriot wing of the party, widely regarded as Schleicher's puppets, is the most supportive of the <span style='color: #c00000;'>**SPD**</span> and ADGB adopting a more nationalist stance.

@changed

We have changed ideologies. Many in the party feel unmoored.
