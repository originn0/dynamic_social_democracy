= Investigating Domestic Enemies

As we have control over the Interior Ministry, we can direct police and intelligence services to investigate internal enemies. We can proscribe various organizations.

As it turns out, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has many allies in the police and bureaucracy. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if sa_banned_pro : Nevertheless, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is substantially weakened by our ban. ?]

[? if coup_progress >= 6: There are reports of an imminent coup by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. We have disrupted some of these plans, but the threat is still present. ?]

The ban is enthusiastically carried out by the police, perhaps too enthusiastically. The <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span> take this as one more reason why the <span style="color: #c00000;">Socialists</span> are traitors to the left. However, the <span style="color: #000000;">moderate</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">center-right</span> parties approve, as do the police. 

[? if judicial_reform < 0: Unfortunately, the reactionary judges let away police who commits violence against civilians when enacting the ban. ?]
